## Robotic_Dynamics 
This repository has all the files used for the robotics and dynamics course taken in the fall of 2024 at SIUE. 
The scripts provided are to calcualte forward, inverse, and velocity kinematics of a 2DOF robot. Only forward kinematics is provided for the 3 DOF robot. 
A simulation for the 2DOF robot is also implemented utilizing a second order differential equation shown in the image below. The initial conditions along with the matrices used are also provided.
